  What did I learn? 🤔
</h2>

<p>
  Here's a list of core concepts I was able to cement after completing this project.
  
  * How classes relate to one another. (Object-oriented Programming)
  
  * Implements vs Extends
  
  * Abstract methods.

  Here is a UML diagram with all the classes that were created, showing the relation and connection between them. Each class contains variables and/or methods.
