<h1>
   Objected-Oriented Programming and Data Structure Projects
</h1>

<p>
  A compilation of the projects I have worked on for in-class assignments that have taught me how to utilize object-oriented programming and data structures.
</p>

<h1>
   Classroom Project

<h2>
  What did I learn? 🤔
</h2>

<p>
  Here's a list of core concepts I was able to cement after completing this project:
  
  * How classes relate to one another. (Object-oriented Programming)
  
  * Implements vs Extends
  
  * Abstract methods.
</p>

<h2>
  Implementation 🔍
</h2>

<p>
  Here is a UML diagram with all the classes that were created, showing the relation and connection between them. Each class contains variables and/or methods.

<h2>
  Future plans? 📅
</h2>

<p>
  For now, I don't plan on doing much more with this project, but in the future I would like to implement a GUI that would make user input far easier.
