<h1>
   Classrooms Project 
</h1>

<p>
  The purpose of this program is to generate classrooms with a room number, a teacher, and student objects, based on user input.
</p>

<h2>
  What did I learn? 🤔
</h2>

<p>
  Here's a list of core concepts I was able to cement after completing this project:
  
  * How classes relate to one another. (Object-oriented Programming)
  
  * Implements vs Extends
  
  * Abstract methods.
</p>

<h2>
  Implementation 🔍
</h2>

<p>
  Here is a UML diagram with all the classes that were created, showing the relation and connection between them. Each class contains variables and/or methods.

<h2>
  Future plans? 📅
</h2>

<p>
  For now, I don't plan on doing much more with this project, but in the future I would like to implement a GUI that would make user input far easier.
