<h1>
   Objected-Oriented Programming and Data Structure Projects
</h1>

<p>
  A compilation of the projects I have worked on for in-class assignments that have taught me how to utilize object-oriented programming and data structures.
</p>

<h2>
   Classroom Project
</h2>
<p> 
   The purpose of this project was to create a classroom object that contained a room number, a teacher object, and student objects, each with their own respective attributes. 
</p>
<p>
  Here's a list of core concepts I was able to cement after completing this project:
  
  * How classes relate to one another. (Object-oriented Programming)
  
  * Implements vs Extends
  
  * Abstract methods.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a UML diagram with all the classes that were created, showing the relation and connection between them. Each class contains variables and/or methods.
</p>

<h2>
   Data Structure Creation Project
</h2>

<p>
   In this project, I was tasked with creating a double linked-list class containing all the methods that its Java library counterpart has.
   
   Here is a list of all the methods I created from scratch:
   
   * add(int index, E e)
   
   * remove(int index)
   
   * addInOrder(E e)
   
   * contains(E e)
   
   * PrintReverse()
   
   * remove(E e)
   
   * getLength()
   
   * get(int index)
   
   * indexOf(Object e)
   
   * lastIndexOf(E e)
   
   * set(int index, E e)
   
   * printList()
   
   * split()
</p>
   
   
<h2>
   Melody Queue Project
</h2>

<p> The purpose of this project was to take a user-generated music sheet and convert it into listenable music. Made using OOP and data structure concepts, specifically stack and queues, the user is able to modify their song by changing it to be in reverse, changing the tempo, repeating the song, and printing the notes. </p>

<p> UML implementation coming soon; for now, here are a list of the methods I created using the Node and Note classes. </p>
   
<p>
   * enqueue(Object item)
   
   * dequeue()
   
   * isEmpty()
   
   * duration()
   
   * timeRepeat()
   
   * size()
   
   * makeString()
   
   * tempoChange(double tempo)
   
   * playRepeat()
   
   * appendMelody(MelodyQueue other)
   
   * reverseMelody()
   
   * play()
</p>
